    When an ally effect makes the opponent discard, and that opponent is human,
    they should be prompted to choose the card to discard (not the AI auto path).

    Scenario:
      - P1 plays Royal Redoubt (Star Empire).
      - We ensure ally condition is satisfied.
      - P2 is human and has a hand with known cards.
      - The prompt appears and P2 selects "Viper" by index.
      - The engine discards *that* chosen card and logs accordingly.
